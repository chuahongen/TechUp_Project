          <p><strong>Mr Jason Matthews</strong><br>
          Mr Jason Matthews is is the founder of Rogue Valley Information Security, a consulting firm specializing in penetration testing and red team engagements. Jason found the offensive side of cyber security very alluring during one the first penetration tests of his career. Feeling the challenge of host defenses like Ant-Virus (AV) and centralized logging, and, at the time, knowing nothing about AV evasion or avoiding events that are likely to cause alerts, it was all very exciting. The challenge of successfully accomplishing the goal of that pen test, using essentially only native tools, was addictive for Jason. He was hooked. Since those first penetration tests, Jason has gone on to become an expert in the field, doing assessments for Fortune 100 companies.
